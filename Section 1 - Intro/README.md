Course link: https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rag-bootcamp-using-langchainlanggraph-langsmith/

This section orients you to the course and the repo. Notes for this section live in `notes.md`.

Files in this folder
- `Section 1 - Intro.txt` — instructor summary (kept for provenance)
- `notes.md` — consolidated section notes (concepts and references)

What you’ll learn (at a glance)
- What Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is and when to use it
- The high-level RAG pipeline (ingest → chunk → embed → index → retrieve → generate)
- Key terms you’ll see throughout the repo (retriever, vector store, embedding model)

Navigation

If you want runnable demos later (embed + index + query), open an issue and I’ll add a small script or notebook.
