This folder follows a single-file-per-section policy. The only note file for this section is `notes.md`.

Files in this folder
- `Section 1 - Intro.txt` — original instructor summary (kept for provenance).
- `notes.md` — consolidated section notes (lecture concepts and references).

Concise summary
---------------
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (search/index) with LLM generation to produce answers grounded in external documents. This section introduces the RAG pipeline, chunking and ingestion basics, embedding-driven retrieval, hybrid search, multi-modal considerations, and higher-level topics like persistent memory and adaptive retrieval.

If you want runnable demos or scripts later (embedding→index→query), I can add them on request; for now this folder contains only the single `notes.md` file.
