# Section 2 — Introduction to RAG (My Notes)

This folder follows the single-file-per-section convention. The canonical notes for this section are in `notes.md`.

Files in this folder
- `notes.md` — consolidated Section 2 notes (pipeline, embeddings, retrievers, vectorstores, experiments template).
- `rag_pipeline.svg`, `chunking_flow.svg` — visuals used in the lecture (kept for reference).
- Instructor PDFs (as provided in this folder).

Quick summary
-------------
Section 2 introduces core RAG concepts: the retriever + reader pattern, chunking and ingestion, embedding-based search, hybrid retrieval strategies, and vectorstore choices for prototyping vs production.
